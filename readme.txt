                    Is overscanning the TOS header !!!

      By the Sommarhack 2020 rules: 
      size of file - 32 bytes header = size of demo

  Gunstick proudly presents the 

                      MINUS 2 BYTES DEMO

And it actually runs (not returning to desktop)! 
So there is even code in it!

I know this will kick ass the usual 32 bytes header rule, so maybe rules
need to become more specific. 
Or executables need to be ckecked by program if the code is effectively
below the required size.
